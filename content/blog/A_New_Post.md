# My First Post

After countless of days working on this blog site project, I am absolutely flabbergasted and tired for the things I have accomplished. It nearly took me 12 days! To create such a blog site...

Even though I am a complete idiot when doing css or some shit, with the help of online resources and all that shenanigans, I did it! Well, I didn't ofcourse manage to code it all one by one, all I can proudly say is that I made this
site with the help of a static site generator! 

So I am very grateful for this, I couldn't thank you more Hugo!

All in all, to end my first blog, and the year... <mark>So long 2021!, and welcome 2022!</mark> may you provide us the hope and gifts for a better tommorrow... Damn I'm completely exhausted :P
