Hey there... again, I really don't know what to say but, there are alot of things happening in my mind
right now. I have no idea why I created this blog post for this day, it's kinda weird to say that but, as
of now I currently have no thoughts and ideas what to post on this blogsite.

### My Current State

I've been working on this [Spotify Downloader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spottydl) project for like 2 weeks now, and I am currently building a
private web app on it, I hope I am doing it the right way lol. But, as you can see you can use it, it is free
and open source and it is currently hosted on Github and NPM, just install it via your node package manager or something, what it does is 
it simply downloads a Spotify track/album when given a Spotify url, check the usage examples on Github, that's all no playlists or anything. I designed it to be minimal like tried to do 
my best on minimizing the number of modules I used in this project. But, without the help of other open source spotify modules, I believe I couldn't do this so I'm very grateful seeing
other examples of such module, at the end it all went well I guess...

```JS
npm i spottydl 
// or
yarn i spottydl
```

So yeah, I hope this module/library of mine gets some little attention because, really I need some help in optimizing
some parts, and yeah, not to mention this module doesn't use any api keys whatsoever... Although, I have to say this
module is purely for educational purposes only, I only created this module because I was curious to learn and regain my knowledge
again when I was still learning Async/Await Javascript or ES6. After all, it has been months I guess since I stopped using Javascript lol
and decided to master C/C++ but, yeah I guess I'm back working on Javascript hehe...
